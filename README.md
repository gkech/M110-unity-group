M110: Unity Project for the group assignment 

The project presents an educational VR experience/game that is very similar to the well-known "escape rooms". The player is required to solve puzzles that are essentially related to computer science in order to achieve the goal. The puzzle implemented was the Tower of Hanoi.

# PLOT

It's 2223 AD, you are a software engineer of the future working hard to upgrade to the latest version of the firmware of the first time machine/portal intended for commercial use. One failure on the pressure of time and the time machine is found to be working. There's nothing you can do to stop it. Seconds later, you found yourself in a time ancient to you when no one has yet discovered the computer, computer science and time travel - officially at least. The truth is that some Illuminati of this past already discovered the time machine, but they hid it well. They found the most incredible puzzles that even they themselves did not understand at the time and locked it behind doors that can only be opened by solving those puzzles. You want to go back to 2223 AD and to do so, you need to figure out how to solve the puzzles to find out how to unlock the portal/time machine. Can you do it?

# TARGET GROUP
The VR experience is intended to be for students, and more specifically high school seniors, interested in studying in the broader area of computer science. Through this they will learn basic computer science concepts and problems, at the same time using advanced technologies for VR and game development. This will help them see the beginning, middle and end of a career in computer science.
